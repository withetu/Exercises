As a prelude to the 4th Lightweight Vehicles Manufacturing Summit 2017 to be held in Detroit, in February, Shawn M. Morgans, Global Vehicle Architecture Manager, Product Development Center, Ford Motor Company gives an insight into his thoughts about the conference and his presentation.

At the 4th Lightweight Vehicles Manufacturing Summit, Shawn will be speaking on a panel session along with two other leading OEMs to consider the potential of each joining technology to meet individual requirements of automakers.

Here is an excerpt from the interview he gave to The Global Automotive Lightweight Materials (GALM Series) Conference website:

GALM: Please tell us a bit about your background and your current role?

Shawn: I am a graduate of Binghamton University in New York with bachelor’s degrees in physics and mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. I started with Ford in 1994 after graduating from grad school. Over my 22 years at Ford I have held engineering and management positions in various departments within our Body Engineering community. I was the Technical Leader and Global Core Manager for the Body Structures organization for 10 years working to develop and implement new technologies and processes. Following that assignment I was the North American Applications Manager responsible for the engineering team that designed and released all front end and under body sheet metal. After 3 years in this role I moved to my current position as the Global Vehicle Architecture Manager responsible for Systems Architecture. The team I lead in this role is responsible for the early engineering and architecture development for all major sub-systems of the vehicle.
