#Create three vectors  x,y,z  with integers and each vector has 3 elements. Combine the three vectors to become a 3×3 matrix  A  where each column represents a vector. Change the row names to  a,b,c.
#Think: How about each row represents a vector, can you modify your code to implement it?
x<-c(1,2,3)
y<-c(4,5,6)
z<-c(7,8,9)
A=cbind(x,y,z) ####if combined by rows A<-rbind(x,y,z)
rownames(A)<-c("a","b","c")
A

#Please check your result from Exercise 1, using  is.matrix(A). It should return  TRUE, if your answer is correct. Otherwise, please correct your answer. Hint: Note that  is.matrix()  will return  FALSE  on a non-matrix type of input. Eg: a vector and so on.
is.matrix(A)

#Create a vector with 12 integers. Convert the vector to a 4*3 matrix  B  using  matrix(). Please change the column names to  x, y, z  and row names to  a, b, c, d.
#The argument  byrow  in  matrix()  is set to be  FALSE  by default. Please change it to  TRUE  and print  B  to see the differences.
b<-c(1:12)
B<-matrix(b,4,3, dimnames = list(c("a","b","c","d"), c("x","y","z")))
B

#Please obtain the transpose matrix of  B  named 
tb<-t(B)
tb

#Now  tB  is a 3×4 matrix. By the rule of matrix multiplication in algebra, can we perform  tB*tB  in R language? (Is a 3×4 matrix multiplied by a 3×4 allowed?) What result would we get?
tb*tb
#although expecting this would return error, it actually passes the computation
# this is due to that * give component-wise multiplication, but not the real matrix #multiplication defined by algebra rules

#As we can see from Exercise 5, we were expecting that  tB*tB  would not be allowed because it disobeys the algebra rules. But it actually went through the computation in R. However, as we check the output result , we notice the multiplication with a single  *  operator is performing the componentwise multiplication. It is not the conventional matrix multiplication. How to perform the conventional matrix multiplication in R? Can you compute matrix  A  multiplies  tB ?
A%*%tb
#use %*% for conventional matrix multiplication
# so matrix A (3x3) multiplies tB(3x4) should be
A
tb

#If we convert  A  to a  data.frame  type instead of a  matrix , can we still compute a conventional matrix multiplication for matrix  A  multiplies matrix  A ? Is there any way we could still perform the matrix multiplication for two  data.frame  type variables? (Assuming proper dimension)
A%*%A  #this is allowed
#if we do
datA<-data.frame(A)
datA%*%datA  #this will return error
#although data.frame type looks the same as matrix 
# we could do
as.matrix(datA)%*%as.matrix(datA)

#Extract a sub-matrix from  B  named  subB . It should be a 3×3 matrix which includes the last three rows of matrix  B  and their corresponding columns.
subB<-B[2:dim(B)[1],1:3]
subB
B

#Compute  3*A ,  A+subB ,  A-subB . Can we compute  A+B? Why?
3*A
A+subB
A-subB
A+B  #not allowed due to improper dimension

#Generate a n * n matrix (square matrix)  A1  with proper number of random numbers, then generate another n * m matrix  A2.
#If we have  A1*M=A2  (Here * represents the conventional multiplication), please solve for  M.
#Hint: use the  runif()  and  solve()  functions. E.g.,  runif(9)  should give you 9 random numbers.
A1<-matrix(runif(16),4,4)
A2<-matrix(runif(8),4,2)
M<-solve(A1,A2)
