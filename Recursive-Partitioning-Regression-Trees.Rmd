#------Consider the tree build in exercise 1.------
#1) Which variables are used to explain kyhosis presence?
#option using plot

cat('the variables are Start and Age')

#2) How many observations contains the terminal nodes.
cat('*denotes terminal nodes. Each nodes has 29, 12, 14, 7 and 19 observations')


# Consider the Kyphosis data frame.
# 1)Build a tree using the first 60 observations of kyphosis.
TREE=rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data=kyphosis[1:60,],method="class")

# 2)Predict the kyphosis presence for the other 21 observations.
