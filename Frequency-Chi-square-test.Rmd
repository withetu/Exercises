#use the attach() command to load the trees dataset in R
attach(trees)

#Use the table() command with the arguments: trees$Height and trees$Volume. This will generate a two-way frequency table. Store this in variable mytable.
mytable=table(trees$Height, trees$Volume)

#If you are familiar with excel pivot tables, then you will know this function. Use the margin.table( ) function to get the Height frequencies summed over Volume
margin.table(mytable,1)

#Use the margin.table( ) function to get the Volume frequencies summed over Height.
margin.table(mytable,2)

#Now use the table() function again but using all the features of the trees dataset, that includes girth, height and volume. This will print out a multidimensional 3 way frequency table.
table(trees$Girth, trees$Height, trees$Volume)

#Suppose you have a variable ‘a’ that stores a second sample of heights of trees.
#a=c(70, 65, 63, 72, 80, 83, 66, 75, 80, 75, 79, 76, 76, 69, 75, 74, 85, 8, 71, 63, 78, 80, 74, 72, 77, 81, 82, 80, 86, 80, 87)
#Use the cbind() to add the a column to your trees dataset. Store the results back into trees.
a=c(70, 65, 63, 72, 80, 83, 66, 75, 80, 75, 79, 76, 76, 69, 75, 74, 85, 8, 71, 63, 78, 80, 74, 72, 77, 81, 82, 80, 86, 80, 87)
trees=cbind(trees, a)

#Now create a 2 way frequency table between Height and a as the arguments. Store this table in mytable_2.
mytable_2=table(trees$Height, trees$a)

#Chi Square test for independance:
#a)Print the results of the summary() function on mytable. Note the Chi Square test for independance results and P value
#b)Print the results of the summary() function on mytable_2. Note the Chi Square test for independance results and P value.
summary(mytable)
summary(mytable_2)

#What did the chi square test for independance help you to see?

##for mytable_2, we are seeing values greater than 1 and there are more matching values than
