#create vectors.
a<- c(4, 5,6,8,3)
b<- c("apple","chair","jetplane","salmon","island")
c<- c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)

#create a dataframe using the variables a,b and c. Store this in df
df<- data.frame(a,b,c)
df

#use the str() command to see the dataframe
str(df)

#print the column names of df
colnames(df)

#change the column names of df to “id”,”wish”,”real”. View the dataframe again using the str() command.
str(df)
colnames(df)=c("id","wish","real")
colnames(df)
str(df)

#select the first column of the df using column name
df['id']
#select the row where id==3. Use this logic to select the row
df[df['id']==3]
#Now use the index method to select the first row in df
df[1,]
#select the second column of the df using index method
df[,2]
#select the second item in the third row of df
df[3,2]

#attach/load the iris dataset and use the str() command to see the dataset
attach(iris)
str(iris)

#change the column names of iris to "sl","sw","sl","pw","s"
colnames(iris)=c("sl","sw","sl","pw","s")
colnames(iris)
str(iris)

#select the rows where ‘sw’ is 3
iris[iris['sw']==3]
#select the first element of the second cloumn
iris[1,2]
#select the first 6 rows of the dataset
head(iris)
#select the last 6 rows of the dataset
tail(iris)
#select every column except the s column
iris[-5]

#select all the rows where sl is greater than 5 and store all the sample in iris_2 making sure to exclude the s column
iris_2<-iris[iris['sl']>5,-5]
iris_2
