#Use read.csv() command to load the lenses.csv data and store it in lens. Use the str() command to see lens.
lens <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\GitHub\\Exercises\\lenses.csv")
str(lens)

#Notice there are no column names. The column names are as follows
#index, age, spec_pres, astigmatic, tpr. Use one line code to change the column names to the aforementioned names.
colnames(lens) <- c("index","age","spec_pres","astigmatic","tpr","class")

#Given the meta data
lens$age[lens$age=="1"]="young"
lens$age[lens$age=="2"]="pre-presbyopic"
lens$age[lens$age=="3"]="presbyopic"
lens$spec_pres[lens$spec_pres=="1"]="myope"
lens$spec_pres[lens$spec_pres=="2"]="hypermetrope"

#Use the str() command to see the changes. Also notice that the astigmatic column is a factor that is also storing numbers as characters. To get all of them in the same format, lets convert it to character. Use the code as.character() to convert this column data type to character.
str(lens)
lens$astigmatic=as.character(lens$astigmatic)

#Now change the astigmatic column data to the right names
lens$astigmatic[lens$astigmatic=="1"]="no"
lens$astigmatic[lens$astigmatic=="2"]="yes"

#Use the following code to replace the 1 with “reduced in the tpr column
lens$tpr[lens$tpr==1]="reduced"
lens
#Now type str(lens) to see the dataframe. Notice that the tpr column data type change to character from integer. Anytime you introduce something that is not a number in a number dataframe, it will become a character.

#Go ahead and replace 2 in the tpr column with “normal”
lens$tpr[lens$tpr=="2"]="normal"

#use the table() command to see the counts of each data type
table(lens$astigmatic)

#Notice that there is a g in the count. That could possibly be a typo. We can go ahead and remove that row since there is only one row with that typo. Hint: You can select all rows that does not have that typo and store it back in the lens dataframe.
lens=lens[lens$astigmatic!="g",]

#Great Work. We realized that the index column is not necessary for our modeling purposes. So lets remove the index column.
lens
lens=lens[-1]
